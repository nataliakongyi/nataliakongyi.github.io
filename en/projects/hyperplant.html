        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          By 2050, almost three planets’ worth of resources would be required to
          sustain current lifestyles shaped by consumerism and unsustainable
          production patterns. This scenario is rooted in a longstanding
          cultural paradigm that separates humans from nature, promoting the
          illusion of environmental dominance and unlimited resources.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>HyperPlant</em> is an interactive system that explores the
          relationship between humans and plants through multisensory
          engagement. Designed for indoor spaces and tested in Lima, the project
          investigates how technology can foster empathy and environmental
          awareness by making interspecies exchanges perceptible. Developed as a
          functional prototype, it proposes a framework for human–plant
          connection based on air phytoremediation and the perception of
          reciprocal care.
        </p>

            alt="HyperPlant system"
          />
          <figcaption>HyperPlant system</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p class="challenge-question">
          How can we reimagine our relationship with nature through a systemic
          and experience-driven approach?
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>HyperPlant</em> is a one-to-one bonding system that translates
          environmental conditions—air quality, humidity, and temperature—into
          intuitive, real-time feedback. Embedded sensors collect and stream
          data to a digital platform, transforming everyday objects into
          responsive elements.
        </p>

        <p>
          The project is grounded in three key concepts: <em>bonding</em>,
          <em>smart spaces</em>, and <em>hybrid realities</em>. The latter
          extends the physical presence of the plant into a virtual environment
          where a digital avatar mirrors its condition—adding emotional depth
          and narrative coherence to the interaction. This immersive strategy is
          complemented by gamification to encourage long-term engagement.
        </p>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <figure class="project-gallery">
          <img
            src="../../shared/assets/images/projects/hyperplant/hyperplant-components.png"
            alt="HyperPlant components"

            system for plant pots with integrated sensors and a breathable case
            that enhances phytoremediation through air injection. The connected
            web app hosts the plant avatars and supports community interaction.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Five plants were shortlisted to develop the avatars and introduce a
          sense of realism into the digital platform, strengthening engagement
          and attachment. The prototype follows a maker-oriented approach using
          a 3D-printed case, an Arduino board, and environmental sensors. Its
          gamified interface explores motivation while envisioning future
          possibilities for collective interaction.

          />
          <figcaption>Plant avatars</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          During a one-week testing phase, the participant quickly developed an
          emotional connection with the plant mediated by its avatar. The user's diary
          revealed attachment, empathy, and growing awareness—confirming the
          potential of interactive media to strengthen interspecies bonds.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>HyperPlant</em> demonstrates how data, design, and narrative
          converge to create hybrid realities that bridge physical and digital
          experiences. It positions interaction design as a tool to cultivate
          awareness—not only of environmental conditions but of the affective
          ties that shape coexistence with other living systems.

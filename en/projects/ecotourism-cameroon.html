        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          Masterplan and landscape design developed for AGRIPO (Agriculteurs
          Professionnels du Cameroun), a local NGO based in Tayab’s community.
          The project proposes a sustainable framework for local ecotourism that
          strengthens environmental stewardship and community participation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The site is located along a departmental road, connecting several
          villages in Cameroon, and covers 10,000 m² wwithin a broader natural
          corridor, integrating two existing cabins into a cohesive ecological
          system. The masterplan enhances these structures through spatial,
          ecological, and experiential strategies that invite visitors to
          connect with nature through landscape, while supporting local
          traditions.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p class="challenge-question">
          How can architecture and landscape design foster ecological awareness
          while minimizing environmental impact?
        </p>
        <p>
          The project explores how design can mediate the relationship between
          people and their natural surroundings through sensory experiences
          related to local ecosystems. It approaches architecture and landscape
          as interconnected systems that evolve together — where spatial design
          becomes a catalyst for environmental empathy, collective learning, and
          sustainable coexistence.
        </p>

            herbs) surrounding flowering plants such as
            <em>Tabebuia rosea</em> and <em>Agapanthus</em>. [2]. An
            <em>Allium</em> zone is introduced around the ecolodges to repel
            mosquitoes. [3]. Fruit trees — avocado, tangerine, and safou — are
            added for food and shade, complemented by legumes that enrich the
            soil. [4]. Native <em>Baobab</em> and <em>Moabi</em>
            trees complete the composition, reinforcing the site’s ecological
            continuity and cultural identity.

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>
          The <em>Ecotourism Masterplan</em> envisions a modular and low-impact
          system where built and natural environments coexist. It defines three
          main circulation paths: a bicycle route connecting nearby settlements,
          a trail to the fishing platform, and an internal circuit linking
          ecolodges with activity zones such as beekeeping and birdwatching.
          Each route merges recreation and education, allowing visitors and
          residents to experience the landscape as a shared, evolving ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Landscape strategies include edible gardens with tomatoes, radishes,
          and cumin (rotational crops); fruit trees and native species such as
          Baobab and Moabi for orientation; and mosquito-repellent plants near
          the ecolodges. These layers of vegetation create microclimates and
          enhance biodiversity, transforming the site into a living laboratory
          for ecological awareness and coexistence.

            I developed <em>Hybrid Natures</em> as an end-to-end
            research-through-design project exploring how hybrid physical–digital systems can foster awareness, empathy, and long-term engagement with socio-environmental issues. The project combines system logic, narrative design, and generative processes to translate complex environmental data into participatory experiences. It investigates how governance, participation, and collective action can be designed as experiential systems rather than abstract structures.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Hybrid Natures</em> is a research-led thesis project developed as
          part of the Master in Creative Computing at ELISAVA / UVic-UCC. It
          aims to explore how design and technology can support individual and
          collective engagement with environmental crises, approaching them as
          interconnected systems rather than isolated issues.
        </p>

        <p>
          By integrating spatial and digital layers, the project connects
          people, communities, and ecosystems, treating data as both a design
          material and a catalyst for engagement. It investigates how
          interaction design, system logic, and narrative structures can foster
          new forms of empathy and participation around endangered causes. The
          first edition focuses on the Amazon Rainforest.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Systems elements</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p class="challenge-question">
          How can design and technology help people understand and engage with
          human–nature relationships from a systemic perspective?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Hybrid Natures</em> addresses this question through the design of
          a hybrid system that combines a digital platform with decentralized
          elements. The system was conceived to connect users with endangered
          territories and indigenous communities, translating complex
          socio-environmental dynamics into an accessible, participatory
          experience that supports understanding and involvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The digital environment is complemented by physical supports that
          display visual and audiovisual media, functioning as decentralized
          access points — or portals — to those ecosystems. These elements were
          designed to reduce abstraction and support users in forming clearer
          mental models of distant and often invisible systems.
        </p>

          />
          <figcaption>Decentralized screens</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>
          The outcomes of this project include both implemented elements and proposed future directions explored through design.
        </p>
        <p>
          The platform’s narrative was designed to unfold the Amazon Rainforest
          progressively — first highlighting the relevance of each selected
          cause, then revealing its vulnerabilities, and finally establishing a
          connection to the viewer’s everyday life. This sequence supports both
          emotional engagement and cognitive understanding, guiding users from
          awareness toward active participation.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this stage, <em>Hybrid Natures</em> introduces a series of
          generative artworks in NFT format, conceived as a participation and
          support mechanism rather than speculative objects. The artworks follow
          a tiered distribution model with variable donation percentages
          allocated to nonprofit organizations working with the cause. All
          pieces were created using p5.js and environmental data from the Amazon
          Rainforest, then minted, listed, and showcased on Manifold. This
          approach reframes NFTs as a participatory design mechanism rather than
          a speculative asset.
        </p>

        <p>
          The result is a hybrid (physical–digital) experience that integrates
          data, imagery, and generative art within a service framework inspired
          by Web3 principles such as decentralization, transparency, and
          collective participation. Gamification strategies were intentionally
          designed to support long-term engagement, encouraging repeated
          interaction and a sense of shared responsibility.

        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Hybrid Natures</em> began as my thesis project for the Master in
          Creative Computing at ELISAVA / UVic-UCC. It aims to raise awareness
          about environmental crisis, from a systemic perspective, to promote individual and collective engagement. 
        </p>
        <p>
          By integrating spatial and digital layers, it connects people, communities and ecosystems, using data as a catalyst — exploring
          how technology can foster new forms of empathy and engagement with
          endangered causes. The first edition is about the Amazon Rainforest.
        </p>

          alt="System's elements - Hybrid Natures" 
        />
        <figcaption>System's elements</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p class="challenge-question">
          How can design and technology help us understand better the relationship between humans and nature from a systemic perspective? 
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Hybrid Natures</em> explores this question with a hybrid system, mergin a digital platform and decentralized elements to connect users with endangered territories and indigenous communities. The digital environment is complemented with physical supports that display visual and audiovisual material, creating portals to those ecosystems. 
        </p>
        <figure class="project-gallery">

          alt="Decentralized screens - Hybrid Natures"
        />
        <figcaption>Descentralized screens</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>
          The platform’s narrative unfolds the Amazon Rainforest progressively — first highlighting the relevance of each selected cause, then revealing its vulnerabilities, and finally stablishing a closer connection to the viewer’s everyday life. This sequence is designed to build both an emotional and cognitive bridge, transforming awareness into active participation. At this stage, <em>Hybrid Natures</em> introduces a series of generative artworks in NFT format, following a tiered distribution model with variable donation percentages to nonprofit organizations engaged with the cause.
        </p>

        <p>
          The result is a hybrid (physical–digital) experience that merges data, imagery, and digital art within a decentralized and inclusive framework inspired by Web3 principles. It integrates gamification strategies to foster collective, long-term engagement. Through the convergence of design, art, and technology, <em>Hybrid Natures</em> invites participants to rethink their relationship with nature — transforming the act of observing into one of belonging.

          I created <em>HyperPlant</em> as a real-time bonding system that explores relational interaction between
          humans and nature at a micro scale, using indoor plants as the medium. I designed and prototyped an
          interactive physical–digital system that translates air quality and environmental data into perceptible
          feedback, enabling users to understand how human activities and plant processes co-shape a shared living
          environment over time.

      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>
        Current production and consumption models assume unlimited resources
        and reinforce a cultural separation between humans and nature. This
        project explores how interaction design and data-driven systems can
        challenge that paradigm by making environmental processes perceptible
        at a human scale.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>HyperPlant</em> investigates how multisensory, interactive systems
        can foster empathy and awareness by mediating relationships between
        humans and plants in indoor environments. Developed as a functional
        prototype, it proposes a framework for human–plant connection based on
        air phytoremediation and the perception of reciprocal care.
      </p>

        <figcaption>HyperPlant system</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p class="challenge-question">
        How can interactive systems help people develop awareness, care, and
        responsibility toward non-human living systems?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>HyperPlant</em> is a one-to-one bonding system that translates
        environmental conditions into intuitive, real-time feedback. Embedded
        sensors (air quality, humidity, temperature) collect and stream data
        to a digital platform, transforming everyday objects into responsive
        elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project is grounded in three key concepts: <em>bonding</em>,
        <em>smart spaces</em>, and <em>hybrid realities</em>. The system
        extends the physical presence of the plant into a virtual space,
        allowing users to perceive care, neglect, and environmental changes as
        narrative feedback that informs behavior over time. Gamification
        mechanisms were introduced to support long-term engagement rather than
        short-term novelty.
      </p>

      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <figure class="project-gallery">
        <img src="../../shared/assets/images/projects/hyperplant/hyperplant-components.png"
          alt="HyperPlant components" />
        <figcaption>
          <em style="font-weight: 500">HyperPlant components.</em> Wearable
          system for plant pots with integrated sensors and a breathable case
          that enhances phytoremediation through air injection. The connected
          web app hosts the plant avatars and supports community interaction.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        I defined, designed, and prototyped the system’s digital interfaces and interaction flows, and developed a
        functional prototype combining
        Arduino-based sensing, 3D-printed components, and a digital platform
        to test interaction and engagement hypotheses. Five plants were
        shortlisted to develop the avatars and introduce a sense of realism
        into the platform, strengthening engagement and attachment. Its
        gamified interface explores motivation while envisioning future
        possibilities for collective interaction.
      </p>

      <figure class="project-gallery">
        <img src="../../shared/assets/images/projects/hyperplant/hyperplant-avatars.png" alt="Plant avatars" />
        <figcaption>Plant avatars</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        During a one-week testing phase, the participant quickly developed an
        emotional connection with the plant mediated by its avatar. The user's
        diary revealed attachment, empathy, and growing awareness—confirming
        the potential of interactive media to strengthen interspecies bonds.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>HyperPlant</em> demonstrates how data, design, and narrative
        converge to create hybrid realities that bridge physical and digital
        experiences. It positions interaction design as a tool to cultivate
        awareness—not only of environmental conditions, but of the affective
        ties that shape coexistence within complex living systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>HyperPlant</em> reflects my approach to designing hybrid systems where interfaces are intentionally designed
      as clear interaction layers — supporting understanding, trust, and long-term engagement across physical–digital
      ecosystems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this project, I explored how data visualization combined with
        narrative feedback can generate emotional engagement beyond
        information delivery. I learned how hybrid physical–digital systems
        can translate invisible environmental processes into meaningful
        experiences, informing the design of connected products, smart
        environments, and long-term engagement ecosystems.

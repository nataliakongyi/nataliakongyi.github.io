        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Hybrid Natures</em> began as my thesis project for the Master in
          Creative Computing at ELISAVA / UVic-UCC. It aims to raise awareness
          about environmental crises, from a systemic perspective, to promote
          individual and collective engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          By integrating spatial and digital layers, it connects people,
          communities, and ecosystems, using data as a catalyst — exploring how
          technology can foster new forms of empathy and engagement with
          endangered causes. The first edition is about the Amazon Rainforest.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p class="challenge-question">
          How can design and technology help us understand better the
          relationship between humans and nature from a systemic perspective?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Hybrid Natures</em> explores this question with a hybrid system,
          merging a digital platform and decentralized elements to connect users
          with endangered territories and indigenous communities. The digital
          environment is complemented with physical supports that display visual
          and audiovisual media, creating portals to those ecosystems.
        </p>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>
          The platform’s narrative unfolds the Amazon Rainforest progressively —
          first highlighting the relevance of each selected cause, then
          revealing its vulnerabilities, and finally establishing a closer
          connection to the viewer’s everyday life. This sequence is designed to
          build both an emotional and cognitive bridge, transforming awareness
          into active participation. At this stage,
          <em>Hybrid Natures</em> introduces a series of generative artworks in
          NFT format, following a tiered distribution model with variable
          donation percentages to nonprofit organizations engaged with the
          cause. All the art pieces were created using p5js and data from the
          Amazon Rainforest. They were minted, listed and showcased in Manifold.
        </p>

        <p>
          The result is a hybrid (physical–digital) experience that merges data,
          imagery, and digital art within a decentralized and inclusive,
          decentralized framework inspired by Web3 principles. It integrates
          gamification strategies to foster collective, long-term engagement.
          Through the convergence of design, art, and technology,
          <em>Hybrid Natures</em> invites participants to rethink their
          relationship with nature — transforming the act of observing into one
          of belonging.

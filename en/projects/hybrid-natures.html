        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
  <em>Hybrid Natures</em> began as my thesis project for the Master in
  Creative Computing at ELISAVA / UVic-UCC. It aims to explore how design
  and technology can support individual and collective engagement with
  environmental crises, approaching them as interconnected systems
  rather than isolated issues.
</p>

        <p>
  By integrating spatial and digital layers, the project connects people,
  communities, and ecosystems, using data as a design material and
  catalyst. It investigates how interaction design, system logic, and
  narrative structures can foster new forms of empathy and participation
  around endangered causes. The first edition focuses on the Amazon
  Rainforest.
</p>

        <figure class="project-gallery">

            src="../../shared/assets/images/projects/hybrid-natures/hybrid-natures-system.png"

          />
          <figcaption>Systems elements</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p class="challenge-question">
          How can design and technology help us better understand the
          relationship between humans and nature from a systemic perspective?
        </p>
        <p>
  <em>Hybrid Natures</em> addresses this question through the design of a
  hybrid system that combines a digital platform with decentralized
  elements. The system was conceived to connect users with endangered
  territories and indigenous communities, translating complex
  socio-environmental dynamics into an accessible, participatory
  experience.
</p>
 <p>
  The digital environment is complemented by physical supports that
  display visual and audiovisual media, functioning as decentralized
  access points — or portals — to those ecosystems. These elements were
  designed to reduce abstraction and support users in forming clearer
  mental models of distant and often invisible systems.
</p>

            src="../../shared/assets/images/projects/hybrid-natures/hybrid-natures-decentralized-screens.png"
            alt="Decentralized screens - Hybrid Natures"
          />
          <figcaption>Decentralized screens</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>
  The platform’s narrative was designed to unfold the Amazon Rainforest
  progressively — first highlighting the relevance of each selected
  cause, then revealing its vulnerabilities, and finally establishing a
  connection to the viewer’s everyday life. This sequence supports both
  emotional engagement and cognitive understanding, guiding users from
  awareness toward active participation.
</p>
 <p>
  At this stage, <em>Hybrid Natures</em> introduces a series of generative
  artworks in NFT format, conceived as a participation and support
  mechanism rather than speculative objects. The artworks follow a
  tiered distribution model with variable donation percentages allocated
  to nonprofit organizations working with the cause. All pieces were
  created using p5.js and environmental data from the Amazon Rainforest,
  then minted, listed, and showcased on Manifold.
</p>


  <p>
  The result is a hybrid (physical–digital) experience that integrates
  data, imagery, and generative art within a service framework inspired
  by Web3 principles such as decentralization, transparency, and
  collective participation. Gamification strategies were intentionally
  designed to support long-term engagement, encouraging repeated
  interaction and a sense of shared responsibility.
</p>

        <p>
  Conceived as a
  <span class="highlight">future DAO-ready structure</span>, the project
  proposes a
  <span class="highlight">tiered NFT participation model</span> to support
  community involvement and decision-making over time. Each release
  would include a <span class="highlight">10,000-edition badge</span> as a
  collective participation layer, with a unique motif per edition. Token
  holders were envisioned to vote on the
  <span class="highlight">theme of future editions</span> and on potential
  <span class="highlight">guest artist collaborations</span>, framing
  governance itself as a designed service experience.
